## Developed by Erik Barroso
BioScript application

Application is currently in AweSim sandbox development mode

## Insperation:
Working at the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center (OARDC) part of my job was assisting Biological researchers trim their Next-Gernation Sequencing Data. Researchers often came to me because of their lack of experience with supercomputing systems, so I would assist them in the creation of PBS scripts or command line executables that they could use to trim their NGS data. 

I helped researchers download necessary software onto their supercomputing system, create scripts based off their data, and run the scripts on their system. After completing my internship at the OARDC I decided to create bioScript to assist researchers in my absence. 

bioScript walks users through entire process from tool specific download steps to the final generation of the command.
bioScipt process follows flow diagram below

Resulting in either the creation of a command line argument or PBS scripts for BBDuk and Trimmomatic trimming tools.
